## Quick Start

**One-Click Start:**

Double-click `run.bat` or run in command prompt:

```batch
run.bat
```

**What it does:**
1. üöÄ Starts all three services (Backend, Frontend, ML)
2. üåê Opens the application in your browser automatically
3. üìä Displays all service URLs and status

**Prerequisites (install once):**
- Python 3.8+ (with pip)
- Node.js 14+ (with npm)
- MongoDB (running locally)

**First-time setup:**
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd ml-services
pip install flask flask-cors requests

# Install Node.js dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install

cd ../frontend/my-app
npm install
```

**That's it!** After first-time setup, just use `run.bat` for instant startup.
