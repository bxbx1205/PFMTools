## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings â†’ Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", select "App passwords"
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `EMAIL_PASS` (not your regular password)

### Alternative Email Providers
The system supports other SMTP providers. Configure as needed:

```env
# For Outlook/Hotmail
EMAIL_SERVICE=hotmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password

# For custom SMTP
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@your-domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Click the "Send Weekly Report" button** in the dashboard navbar
2. **Enter your email address** in the modal
3. **Click "Send Report"** to receive your weekly financial summary
4. **Check your email** for the comprehensive report

### For Developers
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install nodemailer` in the backend
2. **Configure email** in the `.env` file
3. **Restart the backend** to load new configuration
4. **Test the functionality** using the email modal

## Email Content Structure

### Report Sections
1. **Header** - Personalized greeting with user name
2. **Summary Cards** - Total spent vs predicted amounts

4. **Next Week Predictions** - AI-generated daily predictions
5. **Category Breakdown** - Spending by expense categories
6. **AI Insights** - Personalized recommendations and tips
7. **Footer** - Company branding and disclaimers

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum 7 days** of expense tracking required for predictions
- **Valid expense data** (non-zero amounts) needed for meaningful insights
- **User profile** information enhances prediction accuracy

## Simulation Mode

If email credentials are not configured, the system runs in **simulation mode**:
- **Console logging** of email content instead of sending
- **Full report generation** and processing
- **Testing capabilities** without requiring email setup
- **Development-friendly** approach

## Security Features

- **JWT authentication** required for all email endpoints
- **Email validation** on both frontend and backend
- **Rate limiting** considerations (implement as needed)
- **Data privacy** - emails are not stored after sending

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid email format** - Frontend validation with helpful messages
2. **Insufficient data** - Clear messaging about minimum requirements
3. **Email service errors** - Graceful fallback to simulation mode
4. **Network issues** - Timeout handling and retry logic

### Troubleshooting
- **Check backend logs** for detailed error information
- **Verify email configuration** in `.env` file
- **Test email connection** using the `/api/email/test` endpoint
- **Ensure sufficient expense data** for meaningful reports

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Email scheduling** - Automatic weekly/monthly reports
2. **Email templates** - Multiple design options
3. **Attachment support** - PDF reports and charts
4. **Email preferences** - User customization options
5. **Analytics tracking** - Email open/click rates

### Customization Options
1. **Report frequency** - Daily, weekly, monthly options
2. **Content selection** - Choose specific sections to include
3. **Design themes** - Multiple color schemes and layouts
4. **Language support** - Multi-language email templates

## Technical Architecture

### Email Flow
1. User clicks "Send Weekly Report" button
2. Frontend opens email modal with validation
3. User enters email and submits form
4. Backend authenticates request with JWT
5. System fetches user's expense data and profile
6. AI service generates predictions (if available)
7. Email service creates HTML template with data
8. Email is sent via configured SMTP provider
9. Success/error response returned to frontend

### Dependencies
- **Backend**: `nodemailer`, `express`, `jsonwebtoken`
- **Frontend**: `React`, `Next.js`
- **Email**: Gmail SMTP or alternative providers

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Create test user account** with expense data
2. **Add daily expenses** for at least 7 days
3. **Click email button** and enter test email
4. **Verify email delivery** and content accuracy
5. **Test error scenarios** (invalid email, no data, etc.)

### Automated Testing
Consider implementing:
- **Unit tests** for email service functions
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Email template tests** for HTML generation
- **Mock SMTP** for testing without real email sending

## Conclusion

The email functionality adds significant value to the PFM Tools platform by providing users with convenient, professional weekly reports. The system is designed to be robust, secure, and user-friendly while maintaining high code quality and extensibility for future enhancements.

The feature successfully replaces the simple "All systems operational" indicator with a much more valuable user-facing functionality that directly enhances the financial management experience.
